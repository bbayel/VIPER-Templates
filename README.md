VIPER Xcode Scene Template 
Based on https://cheesecakelabs.com/blog/ios-project-architecture-using-viper/

There's a template in the project directory that you must use to create a Scene

Using Xcode 8/9 you have to copy the Viper folder into :

~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/File\ Templates/

Then (after restarting XCode) you can create a New File / Viper / Scene.
